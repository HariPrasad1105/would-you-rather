# Would You Rather


The **Would You Rather** app is a game that presents the user with a poll in the form of:

## Would you rather…

- Option A <br />
- Option B <br />

The user will be able to answer the question and upon answering will be able to see the polling results.

It's built with React, Redux, React Router, & Redux Thunk.

The app will allow users to
